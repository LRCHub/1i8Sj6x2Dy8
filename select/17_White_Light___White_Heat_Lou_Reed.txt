White light goin' messin' up my mind
Don't you know, it's gonna make me go blind
White heat, goin' down to my toes
Lord have mercy, white light had it, goodness knows

White light goin' down to my brain
Hey, don't you know it's gonna make me insane
White heat, down to my toes
Lord have mercy, white light had it, goodness knows
Forget it

White light
Oh, white light
Ah, white heat
Oh, yeah, white light

White light goin' messin' up my mind
Don't you know, it's gonna make me go blind
White light, goin' down to my toes
Lord have mercy, white light had it, goodness knows

White light goin' messin' up my brain
Don't you know it's gonna make me insane
White heat, goin' down to my toes
Lord have mercy, white light had it, goodness knows
Forget it

Wooh, white light
Yeah, ah, white light
White heat
Oh, baby, white light
White light, now, now, now

White light goin' messin' up my mind
Don't you know, it's gonna make me go blind
White heat, goin' down to my toes
Lord have mercy, white light had it, goodness knows

White light goin' down to my brain, ooh-oh
Don't you know it's gonna make me insane
White heat, goin' down to my toes
Lord have mercy, white light had it, goodness knows
Forget it

White light
Oh, white light
Ooh, baby, white heat
Yeah, white light
