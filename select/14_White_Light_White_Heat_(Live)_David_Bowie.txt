{Verse 1
[White light] White light gonna drive me out of my brain
[White light] White light gonna make me feel so insane
[Whiteheat] White shapin' them down to my toes
[White light] White light's got a nana, goodness knows
{Verse 2
[White light] White light gonna drive me out of my mind
[White light] White light is surely gonna make me blind
[Whiteheat] White shaping way down to my toes
[White light] White light could kill me now, goodness knows
{Chorus
Oh, Oh, White light
Oh, Oh, White light
Oh, Oh, White heat
Oh, Oh, White heat
{Verse 1
[White light] White light has got it now, goodness knows
{Verse 2
{Chorus
{Chorus
White light's a-flashin'
White light
Don't feel sorry
What's that sound, what's that sound,
Don't turn on, be deader alive
No feelin'
Here she comes
Oww, yeah
[Oh, oh, oh, oh] here she comes
[Oh, oh, oh, oh]
[Ah, ah, ah, ah]
